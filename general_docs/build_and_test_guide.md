# Building and Testing Nanite ISO

This document provides a comprehensive guide for building and testing the Nanite ISO image. It covers the entire process from initial build setup to testing and validation, ensuring a functional AI-powered Linux distribution.

## Build Environment Preparation

Before building the Nanite ISO, ensure your build environment is properly configured:

```bash
# Create a dedicated build directory
mkdir -p nanite-build
cd nanite-build

# Install required packages for building
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y live-build debootstrap squashfs-tools xorriso isolinux syslinux-common

# Ensure sufficient disk space (at least 20GB free)
df -h .

# Ensure sufficient memory (at least 4GB recommended)
free -h
```

## Building the Initial ISO

The build process involves several stages and may take significant time depending on your system's performance and internet connection:

```bash
# Initialize the live-build configuration
lb config

# Apply all the configuration settings from the configuration guide
# (This includes setting up package lists, hooks, and custom files)

# Clean any previous build artifacts
sudo lb clean

# Start the build process
sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build.log
```

The build process typically follows these stages:

1. **Bootstrap**: Creating the base Debian system
2. **Chroot**: Installing packages and applying customizations
3. **Binary**: Creating the bootable ISO image
4. **Cleanup**: Finalizing the build

During the build, you can monitor progress through the terminal output or by checking the `build.log` file. The entire process may take 30 minutes to several hours depending on your system's performance and internet connection speed.

## Common Build Issues and Solutions

### Package Installation Failures

If package installation fails during the build:

```bash
# Check the apt logs in the chroot environment
cat chroot/var/log/apt/term.log

# Fix package conflicts or missing dependencies
# Edit the package lists in config/package-lists/
# Then clean and rebuild
sudo lb clean
sudo lb build
```

### Hook Script Failures

If hook scripts fail during execution:

```bash
# Check the hook execution logs
cat chroot/debootstrap/debootstrap.log

# Debug and fix the failing hook script
# Edit the script in config/hooks/live/
# Then clean and rebuild
sudo lb clean
sudo lb build
```

### Space Issues

If the build fails due to insufficient disk space:

```bash
# Clean up unnecessary files
sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoremove

# Remove previous build artifacts
sudo lb clean --purge

# Check available space again
df -h .

# Restart the build
sudo lb build
```

## Testing the ISO Image

After successfully building the ISO, it's crucial to thoroughly test it:

### Basic ISO Validation

```bash
# Verify the ISO was created
ls -lh *.iso

# Check the ISO integrity
md5sum *.iso > nanite.md5
```

### Testing in QEMU

QEMU provides a quick way to test the ISO without creating a full virtual machine:

```bash
# Install QEMU if not already installed
sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86

# Test boot with QEMU (allocate at least 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores)
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -cdrom nanite-*.iso -boot d
```

### Testing in VirtualBox

For more thorough testing, use VirtualBox:

```bash
# Create a new virtual machine
VBoxManage createvm --name "Nanite Test" --ostype Debian_64 --register

# Configure the VM with sufficient resources
VBoxManage modifyvm "Nanite Test" --memory 4096 --cpus 2 --vram 128 --graphicscontroller vmsvga

# Create a virtual hard disk
VBoxManage createhd --filename "NaniteTest.vdi" --size 20480

# Attach the hard disk and the ISO
VBoxManage storagectl "Nanite Test" --name "SATA Controller" --add sata --controller IntelAHCI
VBoxManage storageattach "Nanite Test" --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium "NaniteTest.vdi"
VBoxManage storagectl "Nanite Test" --name "IDE Controller" --add ide
VBoxManage storageattach "Nanite Test" --storagectl "IDE Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type dvddrive --medium nanite-*.iso

# Start the VM
VBoxManage startvm "Nanite Test"
```

## Testing Checklist

During testing, verify the following aspects of the Nanite distribution:

### System Boot and Installation

- [ ] ISO boots properly in live mode
- [ ] All hardware is properly detected
- [ ] Installation process works correctly
- [ ] System boots properly after installation

### Desktop Environment

- [ ] XFCE desktop loads correctly
- [ ] Panel and desktop icons are visible
- [ ] Theme and appearance match design specifications
- [ ] System menus contain all expected applications

### AI Components

- [ ] Ollama service starts automatically
- [ ] Pre-loaded models are available
- [ ] AI Assistant is accessible from panel
- [ ] Command-line AI tools function correctly
- [ ] Speech recognition and synthesis work

### Performance Testing

- [ ] System responsiveness is acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage is within expected range
- [ ] CPU usage during idle is reasonable
- [ ] AI model loading time is acceptable
- [ ] AI response time is reasonable

## Debugging and Issue Resolution

If issues are encountered during testing:

### System Boot Issues

```bash
# Check boot logs
dmesg | less

# Check system logs
journalctl -b
```

### AI Component Issues

```bash
# Check Ollama service status
systemctl status ollama

# Check AI Assistant service status
systemctl status nanite-assistant

# Check service logs
journalctl -u ollama
journalctl -u nanite-assistant

# Test Ollama directly
ollama run mistral -c "Hello"
```

### Desktop Environment Issues

```bash
# Check X server logs
cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log

# Check XFCE session logs
cat ~/.xsession-errors
```

## Creating the Final Optimized ISO

After testing and resolving any issues, create an optimized final ISO:

```bash
# Clean the build environment
sudo lb clean

# Apply optimizations to configuration
# - Reduce included packages if needed
# - Optimize compression settings
lb config --binary-images iso-hybrid --binary-compression xz

# Rebuild with optimizations
sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build_final.log

# Verify the final ISO
ls -lh *.iso
md5sum *.iso > nanite_final.md5
```

## Final Validation

Perform a final validation of the optimized ISO:

```bash
# Test boot with QEMU
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -cdrom nanite-*.iso -boot d

# Verify all critical functionality
# - System boot
# - Desktop environment
# - AI components
# - Performance
```

## Preparing for Distribution

Once the ISO is fully tested and validated:

```bash
# Rename the ISO with version information
mv live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso nanite-ai-linux-$(date +%Y%m%d).iso

# Generate checksums
md5sum nanite-ai-linux-*.iso > nanite-ai-linux-$(date +%Y%m%d).md5
sha256sum nanite-ai-linux-*.iso > nanite-ai-linux-$(date +%Y%m%d).sha256

# Create a release notes file
cat > release-notes.txt << EOF
