   tools = [
       Tool(
           name="Search",
           func=lambda q: "Search results for: " + q,
           description="Useful for searching information"
       )
   ]
   
   agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
   agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
