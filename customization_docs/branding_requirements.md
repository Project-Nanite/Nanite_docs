# Nanite Branding and Customization Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the in-depth customization and branding guide for the Nanite Linux distribution. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource detailing methods, commands, and code examples for customizing both the operating system and the Calamares installer.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Operating System Customization
- **Theming**: Detailed instructions for customizing GTK themes, icon themes, cursors, and fonts.
- **Desktop Environment**: Specific customization for XFCE (panel, menus, window manager).
- **Boot Splash (Plymouth)**: Methods for creating and applying custom boot splash screens.
- **Login Screen (LightDM)**: Customization of the login screen appearance and behavior.
- **Default Settings**: How to set default application settings, keyboard layouts, and system configurations.
- **Wallpapers**: Integrating custom wallpapers and setting defaults.

- **Welcome Screen**: Customizing the initial welcome screen.
- **Look and Feel**: Theming the Calamares interface itself.
- **Post-install Scripts**: Adding custom scripts to run after installation.

### 4. Deliverables
- **Comprehensive Guide**: A detailed Markdown document covering all aspects of customization and branding.
- **Commands and Code**: Specific commands and code snippets for implementation.
- **Example Assets**: Sample branding assets (logos, themes, wallpapers) if feasible.
- **Live-build Integration**: Instructions on how to integrate these customizations into the Live-build process.

## Technical Specifications
- **Target Environment**: Nanite Linux (Debian-based, XFCE)
- **Build System**: Live-build
- **Installer**: Calamares
- **Format**: Detailed Markdown guide with code examples.

## Scope
- Focus on visual and functional customization relevant to branding.
